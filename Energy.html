					<p>What was really cool is that I started generating power right away, I just couldn’t sell back to the power company until all the approvals. The latter took several months but it wasn’t a concern since between running the house and charging my car I only lost a couple dollars. I am also increasing my electric usage and reducing my natural gas bill. As I need to replace worn equipment, I have been slowly moving away from fossil fuels. My first purchase was in Dec 2017 when I bought a used Nissan Leaf for $8,000. In 2018 we remodeled our kitchen and we replaced the natural gas stove with and induction stove $2,800. In 2021 I purchased a Tesla Model 3 to drive back and forth from my new job. I don’t now use the Leaf as my truck, also known as the beater, and I used it to for running around town and hauling junk. My next purchase will be a heat pump, hopefully in late Spring 2023. Some efficiency gains would be rerouting all the duct work, and reinsulating the attic. I expect this will cut my heating and cooling cost by 20%. 
						This roof is definitely the nicest rood in the area, an upgrade, and will increase my property value just like remodeling your kitchen or bathroom. The advantages over those upgrades is the roof will save money, the Powerwall provides a powerbackup, and we are now semi-independent of the utility company. Before I get into the power generation, I knew going into this my house was not ideal or even remotely suited for solar, I have a 150 year old oak tree that shades the house in the afternoon. While this greatly reduces my solar energy production in the afternoons, my peak production is about 10:30 am, the tree keeps the sun from heating up the house in the summer and has only a small effect in the winter. This data is all pulled from the App that comes with the roof, very cool.

					<p>	My electric bill almost never goes over $100/mo, including driving an electric car about 100 miles/week. After 10 months my electric savings is almost $400 and is about what I expected going into this. I expect savings to go up because two pine trees were cut that shaded my house in the winter last year. There is a stream restoration project behind my house. There is another soft maple tree that will probably have to come down in a year or two that is just south of the house. This will also increase my electric generation probably by 10%. I’ll update this once I have that data. My lowest production is October because of all the trees/shade and November my production is starting to go back up.
