					<p>I wanted to share my experience and data with those who are looking for more detail on solar roofs, my experiences, and how things are going. In my opinion, you will be hard pressed to find a nicer roof in the area, you do get what you pay for.  Also, if you decide to install a solar roof please use my referral link <a href="https://ts.la/paul14226" target="_blank">https://ts.la/paul14226</a> and we can both get a credit with Tesla.

					<p>On June 13, 2017 I placed $1,000 deposit on a Tesla Solar roof. As with other products from Tesla, there was no cost and they had 4 conceptual design options. In the end there was only one available. After paying my deposit, over the next 4.5 yrs I worried if my current roof was going to make it. The picture above is the day they ripped off my roof and as you can see this roof should have been replaced long before it was. I did have to replace some shingles and resealed around vents as well as some preventive measures. As it turned the decking was in great shape. Only two pieces needed to be replaced.
						<p>
					
					<p>Before 2017, I spent several years researching options, other alternatives to asphalt shingles that I consider a nasty and ugly product. Also, the water coming off asphalt shingles pick up toxins that I use to water some vegetable plants. Originally, I was very interested metal roofing (something fancy that would get approved by the HOA) but if I ever decided to go solar I didn’t like the idea adding potential areas for leaks caused by all the support structure for the panels . When I saw Tesla had a solar roof, combination solar and metal that integrated into my house I was very interested.  <p>
				
					<p>After a roller coaster ride of being notified in early 2020 that Tesla wasn’t coming to North Carolina any time soon, finally in February of 2021, I received an email that the Tesla Solar Roof was finally being offered in North Carolina. Time was running out on the 26% tax credit and my shingles. I didn’t need any more delays. There were a few steps in the process, Solar Roof Purchase Agreement (actually had 3 of them but that may not be typical), getting HOA approval could have been worse, sending in pictures of my meter, garage, and electrical panel. A couple months before the installation started Tesla came out and took some slope measurements and verified the installation feasibility.  
					</p>

					<p>On Friday, January 7, 2022, the first material arrived and the installer showed up on Monday. There were no trained installers in NC and the Tesla installers came down from Pittsburg to install my roof and were the best group of guys I have worked with and extremely professional. As it turned out the roof design changed several weeks before and I still didn’t know what I bought as far as kWh system or a final price. I chalked the confusion on being the 3rd installation in North Carolina. The installation should have been done in a week but the guys kept running out of material. This was 2022 during COVID, the time that shortages of everything were going on… including truck drivers.
